    "9f395c79-97f1-5b2e-9005-a2facac4cc5a": "No dependencies - this is the foundational setup task",
    "4d4e0135-52d0-5046-a1c9-e7c28296217d": "Depends on task 1 because libraries need to be installed into the configured environment",
    "5861e9c4-689e-5f14-851d-ec5de13c0f0c": "No dependencies - asset creation can happen independently",
    "9b1e1400-992d-54ef-9f9b-e4f733e63d6a": "Depends on tasks 1 and 2 because bird physics needs the development environment and libraries",
    "4f1cc870-2ca3-515b-ac8d-f1f2785b1be4": "Depends on tasks 3 and 4 because obstacles need both assets and bird physics to be implemented",
    "c605f861-41de-579f-aa03-24d04cbf8980": "Depends on tasks 4 and 5 because scoring needs both bird controls and obstacle system",
    "aaeb31bb-80e4-563e-b769-93d41de2e41d": "No dependencies - reading about embedding models is an independent task"
